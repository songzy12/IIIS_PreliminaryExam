Initially, we have $n$ empty bins. In each round, we throw a ball into a uniformly random chosen bin. Let $T$ be number of rounds needed such taht no bin is empty. Show that $E[T]=nH_n$ where $H_n = \sum_{i=1}^n\frac{1}{i}$.

\ \\{\bf Solution:} We denote $E_m$ as the expected number of rounds needed when there are still $m$ bins are left empty.
\[
E_m = \frac{m}{n} (1+E_{m-1}) + \frac{n-m}{n} (1+E_m)
\]
\[
E_0 = 0
\]
Then we have
\[
E_m = E_{m-1} + \frac{n}{m}
\]
\begin{eqnarray*}
E_n &=& E_{n-1} + \frac{n}{n} \\
&=& E_{n-2} + \frac{n}{n-1} + \frac{n}{n}\\
&=& E_0 + \frac{n}{1} + \dots + \frac{n}{n} \\
&=& n H_n
\end{eqnarray*}
