\begin{enumerate}
\item In any bipartite graph, the number of edges in a maximum matching equals the number of vertices in a minimum vertex cover.

\ \\{\bf Solution:} Suppose the set of edges in the maximum matching is $M$, the set of vertices in the minimum vertex cover is $K$. Then we want to prove $|K|\ge |M|$ and $|K|\le |M|$.

$|K|\ge|M|$: No vertex in a vertex cover can cover more than one edge of $M$, that is, the number of vertex cover cannot be less than $|M|$. 

$|K|\le|M|$: Here we will find a vertex cover $K$ with exactly $|M|$ vertices. 

\item In any bipartite graph, the number of vertices in a maximum independent set equals the total number of vertices minus the number of edges in a maximum matching.

\ \\{\bf Solution:} A set of vertices is a vertex cover if and only if its complement is an independent set.
