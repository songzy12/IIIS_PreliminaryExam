When are the following search algorithm optimal (i.e., find a solution that satisfies the goal conditions while incurs minimum cost)? Please be precise about the conditions you define.
\begin{enumerate}
\item BFS
\item DFS
\item A*
\end{enumerate}

\ \\{\bf Solution:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item BFS is optimal if the path cost is a nondecreasing function of the depth of the node. The most common such scenario is that all actions have the same cost. (AIMA P82). 
\item The advantage of DFS over BFS is in the space complexity. (AIMA P86) So when there is only one unique goal with a deep path, DFS is optimal.
\item  the tree-search version of $A^*$ is optimal if $h(n)$ is admissible, while the graph-search version is optimal if $h(n)$ is consistent (AIMA P95).
\end{enumerate}
