\begin{enumerate}
\item Most of the DNA sequences in the human genome code for proteins. 

{\bf Solution:} False.
\item There are 64 codons for translating RNAs into proteins. 

{\bf Solution:} False. 61. 3 stop codons.
\item In the central dogma of molecular biology, DNAs are transcribed into RNAs, while RNAs are translated into proteins. 

{\bf Solution:} True.
\item In genetic code, each RNA nucleotide codes for each amino acid. 

{\bf Solution:} False. 3 RNA codes for one animo acid.
\item For protein backbone structure, each residue only has one degree of freedom.

{\bf Solution:} 
\item All proteins have unique backbone conformations.

{\bf Solution:}
\item The protein design problem is NP-hard problem.

{\bf Solution:}
\item Both DNAs and proteins have fixed 3D conformations.

{\bf Solution:}

\item RNA strands can double back and form loops.

{\bf Solution:}
\item Each drug can only interact with a unique target protein.

{\bf Solution:}
