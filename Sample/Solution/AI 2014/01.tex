{\bf Solution:} Let $dp[i][j]$ be the length of maximum subsequence from s[i...j]. Then we have 
\[ dp[i][i]=1 \]
\[ dp[i][j]=0, \forall i > j \]
\[ dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1]) \ \text{if } s[i]\ne s[j] \]
\[ dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i+1][j-1]+2)\ \text{if }  s[i] == s[j]\]
Note dp array is in size $O(n^2)$, thus our algorithm running time.
