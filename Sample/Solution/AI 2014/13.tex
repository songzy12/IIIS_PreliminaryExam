\begin{enumerate}
\item Which of the two choices Single Linkage or Complete Linkage clustering will typically result in clusters with a small diameter? Why?

\ \\{\bf Solution:} In single-link clustering or single-linkage clustering , the similarity of two clusters is the similarity of their most similar members. In complete-link clustering or complete-linkage clustering , the similarity of two clusters is the similarity of their most dissimilar members.

Complete Linkage. Since in Single Linkage clustering, more distant parts of the cluster and the clusters' overall structure are not taken into account

\item The algorithm's output can be visualized using a dendrogram. Explain in one or two sentences if there are any disadvantages of dendrograms on this dataset.

\ \\{\bf Solution:} The dendrograms may be complex, and the horizontal split line may be hard to recognize.

\item Explain in one or two sentences if there would be any advantage of instead using the k-means algorithm on this dataset.

\ \\{\bf Solution:} The time complexity and space complexity is lower.
